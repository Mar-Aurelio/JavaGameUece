## Game
Start by selecting how many players will play (from 1 to 6), players are assinged different types of luck (Regular, Lucky and Unlucky) that dictate the range of values they can expect from dice rolls. You execute turns by pressing Enter, there are different types of spaces you can land on:
- Regular: does nothing
- Luck: moves the player 3 spaces ahead if they are not unlucky
- Skip: skip the player's next turn
- Swap: swaps the player with the player farthest away from the goal
- Surprise: changes the player's luck randomly
- FU: the player can select any player to send back to the start

The goal is to get to or past square 40.
